Save and restore the position of on-screen program windows

I like to set up my program windows for maximum efficieny - on the correct 
monitor at the right location so that I can see all windows for a 
particular task at the same time, etc. There are other programs out there that 
help with this, but most of them do a lot more than I need, or want. Most 
modern programs resart at their last open position automatically so I don't 
need my  window location manager to position new windows when programs start 
or open a new window. Rather, if something happens to change that 'breaks' 
my setup, such as closing a program's windows in the wrong order to move its 
default position or a pdf coded to move the Acrobat window (imho a pointless 
'feature' that shouldn't exist), I just want to be able to restore that one 
program's window to my preferred location.
